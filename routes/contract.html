<h1>Course Contract</h1>
<body>
    I, Daniel Barry, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2024 WEB250 Course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

    Signed: Daniel Barry, 01/22/2024
